@page recommanded_libraries Recommanded libraries

gf does not provide everything, its main focus is on graphics. Here is a list of recommanded C++ libraries that can be used:

@section recommanded_libraries_threading Threading

- No need for an external thread library, C++11 provides [threads, mutexes, condition variables and futures](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread).

@section recommanded_libraries_network Network

- [Asio](http://think-async.com/) or [Boost.Asio](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/asio/): This library will be integrated in the future C++ standard, so it can be used safely if you want a future-proof networking library (Boost Software License).
- [ENet](http://enet.bespin.org/): It's a reliable UDP networking library used in the game industry (MIT licence).

@section recommanded_libraries_audio Audio

- [SFML Audio](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.3/#audio-module): This part of SFML is independent and can be used without the rest of SFML, it is a simple abstraction above [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/) (zlib/libpng license).
- [PortAudio](http://portaudio.com/): This library is a low-level audio I/O library (MIT license).
- [SoLoud](http://sol.gfxile.net/soloud/index.html): This library is an easy to use audio engine for games (zlib/libpng license).
- [libsoundio](http://libsound.io/): This library is a a lightweight abstraction over various sound drivers (MIT license).

@section recommanded_libraries_physics Physics

- [Box2D](http://box2d.org/): This library is a 2D physics engine for games (zlib/libpng license).

@section recommanded_libraries_serialization Serialization

- [Boost Serialization](http://www.boost.org/libs/serialization): The serialization library of the Boost project (Boost Software License)
- [cereal](http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/): This library is a header-only C++11 serialization library (BSD license).
