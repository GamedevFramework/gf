## Context

This game is an adaptation of a game made for the [International Year of Light](http://www.light2015.org/) in 2015. The original game's input was a "lightpad", a piece of cardboard filled with light sensors that was connected to the computer. The player had to use a flashlight in order to indicate the position of the ship. The game was played during two days consecutively in fall 2015 in an event around the Year of Light in Besançon, France. It had a great success.
