   * @brief A point associated with a color and a texture coordinate
   *
   * gf::Vertex represents the association between a position in the world, a
   * color and texture coordinates.
   *
   * A vertex is the building block for drawing. Everything which is visible
   * on screen is made of vertices. They are grouped as 2D primitives
   * (triangles, etc), and these primitives are grouped to create even more
   * complex 2D entities such as sprites, shapes, etc.
   *
   * If you use the graphical entities of gf (sprite, shape), you won't have
   * to deal with vertices directly. But if you want to define your own 2D
   * entities, using vertices will allow you to get maximum performances.
   *
   * The texture coordinates are in the @f$ [0, 1] @f$ range. @f$ (0,0) @f$
   * is the top-left of the texture while @f$ (1,1) @f$ is the bottom right
   * of the texture. If a coordinate is outside the @f$ [0, 1] @f$ range, the
   * texture is clamped or repeated (see Texture::setRepeated).
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * ~~~{.cc}
   * // define a triangle
   * gf::Vertex triangle[3];
   * triangle[0].position = { 0.0f, 0.5f };
   * triangle[0].color = gf::Color::Red;
   * triangle[1].position = { 0.5f, -0.5f };
   * triangle[1].color = gf::Color::Green;
   * triangle[2].position = { -0.5f, -0.5f };
   * triangle[2].color = gf::Color::Yellow;
   *
   * // and draw it
   * renderer.draw(triangle, 3, gf::PrimitiveType::Triangles);
   * ~~~
   *
