  /**
   * @ingroup graphics
   * @brief An OpenGL vertex and/or fragment shader
   *
   * Shaders are programs written using a specific language,
   * executed directly by the graphics card and allowing
   * to apply real-time operations to the rendered entities.
   *
   * There are two kinds of shaders:
   *
   * - vertex shaders, that process vertices
   * - fragment (or pixel) shaders, that process pixels
   *
   * A gf::Shader can be composed of either a vertex shader
   * alone, a geometry shader alone, a fragment shader alone,
   * or any combination of them. (see the variants of the
   * load functions).
   *
   * Shaders are written in GLSL, which is a C-like
   * language dedicated to OpenGL shaders. You'll probably
   * need to learn its basics before writing your own shaders
   * for gf. See also @ref shader.
   *
   * Like any C/C++ program, a GLSL shader has its own variables
   * called _uniforms_ that you can set from your C++ application.
   * gf::Shader handles different types of uniforms:
   *
   * - scalars: `float`, `int`
   * - vectors (2, 3 or 4 components)
   * - matrices (3x3 or 4x4)
   * - samplers (textures)
   *
   * Every uniform variable in a shader can be set through one of the
   * setUniform() overloads. For example, if you have a shader with the
   * following uniforms:
   *
   * ~~~
   * uniform float offset;
   * uniform vec3 point;
   * uniform vec4 color;
   * uniform mat3 matrix;
   * uniform sampler2D overlay;
   * ~~~
   *
   * You can set their values from C++ code as follows:
   *
   * ~~~
   * shader.setUniform("offset", 2.0f);
   * shader.setUniform("point", gf::Vector3f(0.5f, 0.8f, 0.3f));
   * shader.setUniform("color", color); // color is a gf::Color4f
   * shader.setUniform("matrix", trans); // trans is a gf::Matrix3f
   * shader.setUniform("overlay", texture); // texture is a gf::Texture
   * ~~~
   *
   * To apply a shader to a drawable, you must pass it as part of the
   * gf::RenderStates in the call to @ref RenderTarget::draw() function:
   *
   * ~~~{.cc}
   * gf::RenderStates states;
   * states.shader = &shader;
   * renderer.draw(sprite, states);
   * ~~~
   *
   * In the code above we pass a pointer to the shader, because it may
   * be null (which means "default shader").
   *
   * Shaders can be used on any drawable, but some combinations are
   * not interesting. For example, using a vertex shader on a gf::Sprite
   * is limited because there are only 4 vertices, the sprite would
   * have to be subdivided in order to apply wave effects.
   * Another bad example is a fragment shader with gf::Text: the texture
   * of the text is not the actual text that you see on screen, it is
   * a big texture containing all the characters of the font in an
   * arbitrary order; thus, texture lookups on pixels other than the
   * current one may not give you the expected result.
