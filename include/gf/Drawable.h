   *
   * gf::Drawable is a very simple base class that allows objects
   * of derived classes to be drawn to a sf::RenderTarget.
   *
   * All you have to do in your derived class is to override the
   * `draw()` virtual function.
   *
   * Note that inheriting from `gf::Drawable` is not mandatory,
   * but it allows this nice syntax `target.draw(object)` rather
   * than `object.draw(target)`, which is more consistent with other
   * classes.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * @snippet snippets/doc_class_drawable.cc mydrawable
   *
