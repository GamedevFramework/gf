   * @ingroup graphics
   * @brief Graphical text that can be drawn to a render target
   *
   * gf::Text is a drawable class that allows to easily display
   * some text with custom style and color on a render target.
   *
   * It inherits all the functions from gf::Transformable:
   * position, rotation, scale, origin. It also adds text-specific
   * properties such as the font to use, the character size, the
   * global color and the text to display of course.
   * It also provides convenience functions to calculate the
   * graphical size of the text.
   *
   * gf::Text works in combination with the gf::Font class, which
   * loads and provides the glyphs (visual characters) of a given font.
   *
   * The separation of gf::Font and gf::Text allows more flexibility
   * and better performances: indeed a gf::Font is a heavy resource,
   * and any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time
   * applications). On the other side, a gf::Text is a lightweight
   * object which can combine the glyphs data and metrics of a gf::Font
   * to display any text on a render target.
   *
   * It is important to note that the gf::Text instance doesn't
   * copy the font that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.
   * Thus, a gf::Font must not be destructed while it is
   * used by a gf::Text (i.e. never write a function that
   * uses a local gf::Font instance for creating a text).
   *
   * Usage example:
   *
   * @snippet snippets/doc_class_text.cc text
   *
   * @sa gf::Font
