   * @brief A TCP listener
   *
   * A TCP listener is a network socket that can handle incoming connections
   * from remote hosts. It can be used to create a TCP server.
   *
   * The listener is associated to a service. The service can be a port number.
   *
   * @snippet snippets/doc_class_tcp_listener.cc listener_port
   *
   * For well-known services, it can also be a name.
   *
   * @snippet snippets/doc_class_tcp_listener.cc listener_service
   *
   * A TCP listener is generally created oustide the main loop. Then, for a
   * synchronous server that handles one connection at the time, the listener
   * accept a connection and handle the client.
