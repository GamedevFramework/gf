  /**
   * @ingroup game
   * @brief A collection of sub-texture
   *
   * A texture atlas is a collection of sub-texture that have been packed
   * together in a single texture. The description of the sub-textures is done
   * in a XML file. This description is a name and the texture coordinates in
   * the texture.
   *
   * Here is an example of a XML file containing an atlas:
   *
   * ~~~{.xml}
   * <TextureAtlas imagePath="bricks.png">
   *   <SubTexture name="brickBlack01" x="718" y="500" width="32" height="32"/>
   *   <SubTexture name="brickBlack02" x="716" y="66" width="64" height="32"/>
   *   <!-- ... -->
   * </TextureAtlas>
   * ~~~
   *
   * gf::TextureAtlas is able to read the XML file and give the coordinates
   * thanks to the name of the sub-texture, either in pixels or in texture
   * normalized coordinates.
   *
   * @sa gf::Texture
