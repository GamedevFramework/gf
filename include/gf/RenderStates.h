  /**
   * @ingroup graphics
   * @brief Define the states used for drawing to a RenderTarget
   *
   * There are four global states that can be applied to
   * the drawn objects:
   *
   * - the blending mode: how pixels of the object are blended with the background
   * - the transform matrix: how the object is positioned/rotated/scaled
   * - the texture: what image is mapped to the object
   * - the shader: what custom effect is applied to the object
   *
   * High-level objects such as sprites or text force some of
   * these states when they are drawn. For example, a sprite
   * will set its own texture, so that you don't have to care
   * about it when drawing the sprite.
   *
   * The transform is a special case: sprites, texts and shapes
   * (and it's a good idea to do it with your own drawable classes
   * too) combine their transform with the one that is passed in the
   * gf::RenderStates structure. So that you can use a "global" transform
   * on top of each object's transform.
   *
   * Most objects, especially high-level drawables, can be drawn
   * directly without defining render states explicitly -- the
   * default set of states is ok in most cases.
   *
   * ~~~{.cc}
   * window.draw(sprite);
   * ~~~
   *
   * When you're inside the `draw()` function of a drawable
   * object (inherited from gf::Drawable), you can
   * either pass the render states unmodified, or change
   * some of them.
   *
   * For example, a transformable object will combine the
   * current transform with its own transform. A sprite will
   * set its texture. Etc.
