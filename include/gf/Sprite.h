  /**
   * @ingroup graphics
   * @brief A drawable representation of a texture, with its
   * own transformations, color, etc.
   *
   * gf::Sprite is a drawable class that allows to easily display
   * a texture (or a part of it) on a render target.
   *
   * It inherits all the functions from gf::Transformable:
   * position, rotation, scale, origin. It also adds sprite-specific
   * properties such as the texture to use, the part of it to display,
   * and some convenience functions to change the overall color of the
   * sprite, or to get its bounding rectangle.
   *
   * gf::Sprite works in combination with the gf::Texture class, which
   * loads and provides the pixel data of a given texture.
   *
   * The separation of gf::Sprite and gf::Texture allows more flexibility
   * and better performances: indeed a gf::Texture is a heavy resource,
   * and any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time
   * applications). On the other side, a gf::Sprite is a lightweight
   * object which can use the pixel data of a gf::Texture and draw
   * it with its own transformation/color/blending attributes.
   *
   * It is important to note that the gf::Sprite instance doesn't
   * copy the texture that it uses, it only keeps a reference to it.
   * Thus, a gf::Texture must not be destroyed while it is
   * used by a gf::Sprite (i.e. never write a function that
   * uses a local gf::Texture instance for creating a sprite).
   *
   * Usage example:
   *
   * @snippet snippets/doc_class_sprite.cc sprite
   *
   * @sa gf::Texture, gf::Transformable, gf::SpriteBatch
