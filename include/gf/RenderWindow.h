   * \brief A window that can serve as a target for 2D drawing
   *
   * gf::RenderWindow is the main class of the graphics module.
   * It defines an OS window that can be painted using the other
   * classes of the graphics module.
   *
   * Here is a typical rendering and event loop with a gf::RenderWindow:
   *
   * ~~~{.cc}
   * // Declare and create a new render-window
   * gf::Window window("New window", { 800, 600 });
   * gf::RenderWindow renderer(window);
   *
   * // The main loop - ends as soon as the window is closed
   * while (window.isOpen()) {
   *   // Event processing
   *   gf::Event event;
   *
   *   while (window.pollEvent(event)) {
   *     // Request for closing the window
   *     if (event.type == gf::EventType::Closed) {
   *       window.close();
   *     }
   *   }
   *
   *   // Clear the whole window before rendering a new frame
   *   renderer.clear();
   *
   *   // Draw some graphical entities
   *   renderer.draw(sprite);
   *   renderer.draw(circle);
   *   renderer.draw(text);
   *
   *   // End the current frame and display its contents on screen
   *   renderer.display();
   * }
