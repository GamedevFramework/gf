  /**

   * @brief Utility class that measures the elapsed time
   *
   * gf::Clock is a lightweight class for measuring time.
   * It is a thin wrapper around C++11
   * [std::chrono::steady_clock](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/steady_clock).
   *
   * Its provides the most precise time that the underlying
   * OS can achieve (generally microseconds or nanoseconds).
   * It also ensures monotonicity, which means that the returned
   * time can never go backward, even if the system time is
   * changed.
   *
   * Usage example:
   *
   * @snippet snippets/doc_class_clock.cc clock
   *
   * The gf::Time value returned by the clock can then be
   * converted to a number of seconds, milliseconds or even
   * microseconds.
   *
   * @sa gf::Time
