   * it possible to draw 2D entities like sprites, shapes, text
   * without using any OpenGL command directly.

   * A gf::RenderTarget is also able to use views (gf::View),
   * which are a kind of 2D cameras. With views you can globally
   * scroll, rotate or zoom everything that is drawn,
   * without having to transform every single entity. See the
   * documentation of gf::View for more details and sample pieces of
   * code about this class.
