   * @brief 2D camera that defines what region is shown on screen
   *
   * gf::View defines a camera in the 2D scene. This is a
   * very powerful concept: you can scroll, rotate or zoom
   * the entire scene without altering the way that your
   * drawable objects are drawn.
   *
   * A view is composed of a source rectangle, which defines
   * what part of the 2D scene is shown, and a target viewport,
   * which defines where the contents of the source rectangle
   * will be displayed on the render target (window or texture).
   *
   * The viewport allows to map the scene to a custom part
   * of the render target, and can be used for split-screen
   * or for displaying a minimap, for example. If the source
   * rectangle has not the same size as the viewport, its
   * contents will be stretched to fit in.
   *
   * To apply a view, you have to assign it to the render target.
   * Then, every objects drawn in this render target will be
   * affected by the view until you use another view.
   *
   * Usage example:
   *
   * ~~~{.cc}
   * gf::RenderWindow renderer;
   * gf::View view;
   *
   * // Initialize the view to a rectangle located at (100, 100) and
   * // with a size of 400x200
   * view.reset({ 100.0f, 100.0f, 400.0f, 200.0f });
   *
   * // Rotate it by 45 degrees
   * view.rotate(gf::Pi / 4);
   *
   * // Set its target viewport to be half of the window
   * view.setViewport({ 0.f, 0.f, 0.5f, 1.f });
   *
   * // Apply it
   * renderer.setView(view);
   *
   * // Render stuff
   * renderer.draw(someSprite);
   *
   * // Set the default view back
   * renderer.setView(renderer.getDefaultView());
   *
   * // Render stuff not affected by the view
   * renderer.draw(someOtherSprite);
   * ~~~
