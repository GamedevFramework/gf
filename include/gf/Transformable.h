   * @ingroup graphics
   * @brief Decomposed transform defined by a position, a rotation and a scale
   *
   * gf::Matrix3f, as a low-level class, offers a great level of
   * flexibility but it is not always convenient to manage. Indeed,
   * one can easily combine any kind of operation, such as a translation
   * followed by a rotation followed by a scaling, but once the result
   * transform is built, there's no way to go backward and, let's say,
   * change only the rotation without modifying the translation and scaling.
   * The entire transform must be recomputed, which means that you
   * need to retrieve the initial translation and scale factors as
   * well, and combine them the same way you did before updating the
   * rotation. This is a tedious operation, and it requires to store
   * all the individual components of the final transform.
   *
   * That's exactly what gf::Transformable was written for: it hides
   * these variables and the composed transform behind an easy to use
   * interface. You can set or get any of the individual components
   * without worrying about the others. It also provides the composed
   * transform (as a gf::Matrix3f), and keeps it up-to-date.
   *
   * In addition to the position, rotation and scale, gf::Transformable
   * provides an "origin" component, which represents the local origin
   * of the three other components. Let's take an example with a 10x10
   * pixels sprite. By default, the sprite is positioned/rotated/scaled
   * relatively to its top-left corner, because it is the local point
   * @f$(0, 0)@f$. But if we change the origin to be @f$(5, 5)@f$, the
   * sprite will be positioned/rotated/scaled around its center instead.
   * And if we set the origin to @f$(10, 10)@f$, it will be transformed
   * around its bottom-right corner.
   *
   * To keep the gf::Transformable class simple, there's only one
   * origin for all the components. You cannot position the sprite
   * relatively to its top-left corner while rotating it around its
   * center, for example. To do such things, use gf::Matrix3f directly.
   *
   * gf::Transformable can be used as a base class. That's what
   * gf's sprites, texts, curves and shapes do.
