# Contributing to Gamedev Framework (gf)

Gamedev Framework (gf) is very open to contributions. There are many ways to
contribute, not just with code. The contributions are handled with the github
[issues of the project](https://github.com/GamedevFramework/gf/issues).

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Report bugs

The first thing you can do is report a bug:

1. Check that your issue is not already reported. In that case, add some
   information on the opened issue. Just indicating that you also experienced
   the issue can be valuable.
2. Open an issue with the [bug label](https://github.com/GamedevFramework/gf/labels/bug).
   Give it a clear name, not too long but precise enough so that the other
   users can identify the bug immediately if they experienced the same bug.
3. Describe your environment as precisely as possible. This includes your
   system (Linux distribution, Windows, etc), the compiler you used, the
   versions of the libraries (SDL, FreeType) and of course, the version of
   Gamedev Framework.
4. Tell how to reproduce the bug. This can be a simple description or a piece
   of code that exhibit the issue. Again, be as precise as possible.
5. Be ready to test a possibly fixed version!

## Improve documentation

Documentation is an important part of Gamedev Framework. You can help here too!

- Report any ambiguous or missing documentation. Do not forget the
  [documentation label](https://github.com/GamedevFramework/gf/labels/documentation).
  Understanding the needs of the users can help improve the documentation for
  everybody.
- Make some corrections in the current documentation. You can open an issue
  with a list of corrections, or use a copy of the repository and send a pull
  request via github or send a [patch by mail](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email)
  to one of the authors.

## Code new features

Gamedev Framework is open to new features, as long as they are useful and
simple enough for most people.

1. Discuss the feature you want to add in an issue with the
   [enhancement label](https://github.com/GamedevFramework/gf/labels/enhancement).
   In particular, give the API you want to offer and a sketch of the
   implementation. Share your ideas and be open to proposals.
2. Make sure you read the developpers' documentation. It gives some precious
   advice for developpers so that they can make code that integrates nicely
   in the existing tree.
3. Code, this is generally the easy part. Always use the `develop` branch or a
   feature branch that branch off from the `develop` branch. Respect the
   existing style. Make some unit tests if it applies. Write useful and clever
   comments if your code is tricky.
4. Make the associated documentation for your feature. This means at least a
   Doxygen documentation. Make a simple example in the `examples` directory.
   If you can, make a tutorial to explain how to use your feature.
5. Do not forget to add yourself in the AUTHORS file!
6. Make a pull request or send your [patch by mail](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email)
   to one of the authors.

## Participate in the development

Once you have contributed enough and know the code quite well, you can be part
of the development team. You just have to ask.
