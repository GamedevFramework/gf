# Gamedev Framework (gf)

__Gamedev Framework (gf)__ is a framework to build 2D games in C++11. It is based on [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [OpenGL ES 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/2_X/), and presents an API that is very similar to the graphics module of [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) with additional features. It is _not_ a [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine), it is more something like a framework, similar to [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) in the Java world.

Gamedev Framework (gf) is licensed under the terms and conditions of the [zlib/libpng license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib).
